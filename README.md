# Self-driving-Car - Lane Detection Algorithm
The the Lane Deteciton Algorithm works with an OpenCV environment setup on Python. Please ensure that first step is done first or else the program will not run smoothely. This program runs on two mediums: image and video. To run it they have two different commands for them.

#Image
- python FinalLaneDetection.py image ".jpg"

#Video
- python FinalLaneDetection.py video "mp4"
If the input video is upside down uncomment line 244.
